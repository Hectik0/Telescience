Telescience
===========
This is a small app developed specificaly for the tg/Station 13 branch of SS13.

It is meant to allow you to plug in numbers, such as the telepad X and Y, and Calibrate the pad with ease. 

To Calibrate:

1) Set the Telepad's Bearing to 0. Set the Elevation to 45. And Set the Power to 20,

2) Send a GPS and mark the coordinates of the Telepad, and the GPS. Fill in the appropiate boxes on the app.

3) Select Calibrate.

To Use: 

1) Find a set of GPS Coordinates to use.

2) Write the Coordinates on the appropriate box. 

3) Set the Power to 5.

4) Set the appropriate direction. (Relative to the pad)

5) Click on Calculate; If the Elevation returns NaN, Raise the power.

Thats It! Enjoy the Code!

NOTE: This is only Version 1.0, I will probably make better versions that auto-calculate Power and Direction. And I will probalby include more Station support on later versions. (Such as Bay Station 12 Telescience code)
